# EcarbonWebsite
I'm working on an Ecarbon initiative with the Mitrphol Company. Thailand's largest sugar business, ranked third globally. This initiative aims to reduce greenhouse gas emissions from farming operations including clearing land, using fuel, and other such activities while simultaneously increasing farmer income through the use of the carbon credit system. The study will identify greenhouse gasses and determine the amount of emissions per ton of carbon using remote sensing technology. Additionally, we obtain a great deal of data from each farmer's planted area, which allows us to compute each farmer's carbon footprint and carbon offset. Since Mitrphol is one of only three companies in Thailand that can pass the T-ver premium standard for three times the price as compared to normal T-ver, we can now get the data to other organizations, such as T-ver or Defire, to obtain the carbon credit and then sell carbon credit for a high value. Farmers everywhere will benefit from this technique as well as our planet.
